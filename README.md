This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard built on the FIFA 2018 player dataset to analyze player performance, potential, compensation, and demographic trends across clubs, positions, and nationalities.

The dashboard enables multi-dimensional exploratory analysis by combining key KPIs (average rating, average potential, average wage) with detailed visualizations that uncover patterns such as:

The relationship between player potential and wage, highlighting how future value drives compensation

Age vs performance trends, revealing peak performance windows and decline phases

Position-wise wage disparities, identifying high-paying roles like strikers and attacking midfielders

Club and country-level insights, including top talent-producing clubs and nations with the highest player concentration and cumulative wages

Designed with a business intelligence mindset, the dashboard uses KPIs, bar charts, treemaps, scatter plots, and ranking tables to translate complex football data into clear, decision-ready insights.
It demonstrates skills in data modeling, exploratory data analysis, insight communication, and executive reporting using Power BI.
